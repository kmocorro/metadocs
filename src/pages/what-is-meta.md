**META** stands for **Manufacturing and Engineering Tool App**.

Genarally, it's a web app that was originally conceived in December 2017 to support the needs of Fab4 manufacturing and engineering requests by building prototypes.

These prototypes usually take 2-14 days to design, develop and deploy. It could even take a lot of weeks depending on the requirements of our manufacturing and engineering team.

### Purpose of META
META hosts dashboards, reports and mailers proven to make quick yet accurate decisions and analysis based directly from equipment logs, operator's transactions and pool of data.
